# Friend-Finder
I have build a compatibility-based Game Of Thrones Theamed "Personality Finder" application. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from Game of Throne's Characters' personality. The app will then display the name and picture of the Game of Throne's Character with the best overall match.

<H2>You can find the running app here - https://friendfinder-app-heroku.herokuapp.com/ </H2>
